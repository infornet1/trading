# Ultra-Conservative Bitcoin Scalping Plan

**CRITICAL**: This document contains strict rules designed to PROTECT your capital. Breaking these rules will likely result in losses.

## Prerequisites (Must Have Before Starting)

- [ ] Emergency fund covering 3-6 months of expenses (separate from trading capital)
- [ ] All high-interest debt paid off
- [ ] Trading capital you can afford to lose 100%
- [ ] Emotional readiness to accept losses without stress
- [ ] Completed at least 2 weeks of paper trading with profitable results

## Account Setup

### Exchange Selection
- **Recommended**: Binance, Coinbase Pro, Kraken
- **Why**: Low fees (0.1-0.25%), high liquidity, reliable
- **Enable**: 2FA, withdrawal whitelist, anti-phishing code

### Fee Structure (Critical for Scalping)
```
Example Trade: $100 position

Maker fee: 0.1% = $0.10
Taker fee: 0.1% = $0.10
Total round trip: $0.20

Break-even point: 0.2% price move
Minimum target: 0.4% (2x fees)
Realistic target: 0.5-0.7%
```

## Capital Management

### The Sacred Rules
1. **Total Capital**: Let's call this X
2. **Active Trading**: Use only 10% of X
3. **Per Trade Risk**: 1% of X maximum
4. **Daily Loss Limit**: 2% of X (HARD STOP)
5. **Weekly Loss Limit**: 5% of X (take break)

### Example with $1,000 Capital
```
Total Capital: $1,000
├── Active Trading: $100 (10%)
├── Reserve: $900 (emergency fund)
├── Risk Per Trade: $10 (1% of total)
├── Daily Loss Limit: $20 (2% of total)
└── Weekly Loss Limit: $50 (5% of total)

Position Size Calculation:
- Entry: $50,000 (BTC price)
- Stop Loss: 0.3% = $49,850
- Risk: $10
- Position Size: $10 / ($150/50000) = $3,333 worth of BTC

This means you can only trade 0.0667 BTC at $50k price
```

## Trading Strategy - "The 3-Confirmation System"

### Entry Requirements (ALL 3 Must Be True)

**Confirmation 1 - RSI Signal**
- LONG: RSI < 25 (deeply oversold)
- SHORT: RSI > 75 (deeply overbought)

**Confirmation 2 - Support/Resistance**
- LONG: Price within 0.3% above support level
- SHORT: Price within 0.3% below resistance level

**Confirmation 3 - Volume & Momentum**
- Clear trend direction on 5-min chart
- No major news in next 2 hours
- Volume above average

### Entry Execution

1. Set stop-loss FIRST (0.3% from entry)
2. Set take-profit (0.5% target)
3. Enter position with limit order
4. DO NOT move stop-loss lower
5. DO NOT add to losing position

### Exit Strategy

**Take Profit Levels:**
- Primary: 0.5% gain (take 70% of position)
- Secondary: 0.7% gain (take remaining 30%)
- Move stop to break-even after first target hit

**Stop Loss:**
- Hard stop: 0.3% loss
- NO EXCEPTIONS
- Accept the loss and move on

**Time-Based Exit:**
- If no movement in 15 minutes, exit at break-even or small loss
- Don't hold positions overnight (weekend)

## Daily Trading Routine

### Pre-Market (Before Trading)
- [ ] Check BTC news (no major events?)
- [ ] Review yesterday's trades (learn from mistakes)
- [ ] Mental check: Am I calm and focused?
- [ ] Verify daily loss limit not reached

### During Trading Hours
- [ ] Monitor the BTC monitor alerts
- [ ] Wait for ALL 3 confirmations
- [ ] Execute with discipline
- [ ] Log every trade (entry, exit, reason)
- [ ] Take breaks between trades (15 min minimum)

### Post-Market (After Trading)
- [ ] Calculate daily P&L
- [ ] Review what worked and what didn't
- [ ] Update trading journal
- [ ] Plan for tomorrow

## The Trading Journal (MANDATORY)

Track every trade in a spreadsheet:

```
Date | Time | Direction | Entry | Exit | P&L | % Gain | Reason | Emotion | Notes
-----|------|-----------|-------|------|-----|--------|--------|---------|-------
10/11| 2:30 | LONG      | 50000 | 50250| +$10| +0.5%  | RSI<25 | Calm    | Good
10/11| 3:15 | SHORT     | 50300 | 50450| -$10| -0.3%  | Hit SL | Anxious | Too fast
```

**Weekly Review**: Calculate win rate, average gain/loss, identify patterns

## Red Flags - STOP TRADING Immediately If:

1. ❌ You're hoping for "just one more trade" to recover losses
2. ❌ You move or remove stop-losses to "give it more room"
3. ❌ You increase position size after losses (revenge trading)
4. ❌ You feel anxious, stressed, or desperate
5. ❌ You hit daily loss limit (2%)
6. ❌ You're thinking about the money you need, not the trade
7. ❌ You skip confirmations because "this one looks good"
8. ❌ You trade on your phone while distracted

## Realistic Expectations

### Conservative Scenario (Good Trader)
```
Starting Capital: $1,000
Win Rate: 55%
Average Win: 0.5% = $5
Average Loss: 0.3% = $3
Trades Per Day: 3
Trading Days/Month: 20

Monthly Calculation:
- Total Trades: 60
- Winning Trades: 33 (55%) = $165
- Losing Trades: 27 (45%) = $81
- Net Profit: $84 (8.4% monthly)
- After Fees: ~$72 (7.2% monthly)

REALISTIC MONTHLY RETURN: 5-7%
```

### What Success Actually Looks Like

**Month 1**: -2% (learning, small losses)
**Month 2**: +3% (getting better)
**Month 3**: +5% (finding rhythm)
**Month 4**: -1% (bad luck, happens)
**Month 5**: +7% (good month)
**Month 6**: +6% (consistent)

**6-Month Average**: ~3% per month
**Annual Return**: ~40% (if you're really good)

## Common Mistakes That WILL Lose You Money

1. **Overtrading**: Taking 10+ trades per day
2. **Revenge Trading**: Trying to win back losses immediately
3. **Moving Stops**: "Just a little more room..."
4. **Position Sizing**: Using too much capital per trade
5. **Ignoring Fees**: Fees eat 30-50% of small profits
6. **No Journal**: Can't learn without tracking
7. **Trading While Emotional**: Anger, fear, hope
8. **Chasing Pumps**: FOMO trading
9. **Holding Losers**: "It will come back..."
10. **Not Taking Breaks**: Burnout leads to mistakes

## The Reality Check

**After 100 Trades, You Should Know:**
- Your actual win rate
- Your average profit/loss per trade
- Whether this strategy works for YOU
- If you can handle the emotional stress

**If after 100 trades you're not profitable, STOP and:**
- Review your journal thoroughly
- Identify your biggest mistakes
- Go back to paper trading
- Consider if trading is right for you

## Emergency Protocols

### If You Lose 10% of Capital in One Week:
1. STOP trading immediately
2. Take 1-week break minimum
3. Review all trades
4. Identify what went wrong
5. Consider reducing position sizes by 50%

### If You Lose 20% of Capital Total:
1. STOP trading for 1 month
2. Do serious soul-searching
3. Paper trade only for 2 months
4. If you restart, use 50% position sizes

### If You Lose 30% of Capital:
1. STOP trading completely
2. Accept that trading may not be for you
3. Preserve remaining capital
4. Focus on other income sources

## Using the BTC Monitor Conservatively

### Alert Settings for Conservative Trading
Run with conservative config:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python btc_monitor.py config_conservative.json
```

### How to Interpret Alerts

**RSI < 25 Alert**:
1. Don't jump in immediately
2. Check support level proximity
3. Look at 5-min chart trend
4. Wait for confirmation candle
5. THEN consider entry

**Email Alerts**:
- Review them, don't react automatically
- Check all confirmations manually
- It's a suggestion, not a command

## Final Words of Wisdom

> "The market is designed to transfer money from the impatient to the patient."

> "Your job is not to make money. Your job is to NOT LOSE money. Profits are a side effect of good risk management."

> "If you're not keeping a journal, you're not a trader - you're a gambler."

**Most Important Rule**: When in doubt, sit it out. Missing a trade is better than taking a bad trade.

---

**Do you agree to follow these rules strictly?**

If not, please do NOT trade with real money. Paper trade until you're ready to commit to the discipline required.

Remember: The market will still be here tomorrow. There's no rush. Protect your capital first, make profits second.
